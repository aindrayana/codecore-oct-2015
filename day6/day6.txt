Rails is very opinionated
Rails = Ruby + Patterns
Rails is a gem

Steps:
1. install database (here we use postgresql)
brew install postgresql

To have launchd start postgresql at login:
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

Then to load postgresql now:
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

2. create new project
ex.
rails new awesome_answers -d postgresql -T
-T: skip testing framewaork
-d: database that is used

3. Go inside the directory and run:
Bundle

4. Rails folder structure:
/app : main folder for application
/app/assets : where css javascript stored
/controllers
/models
/views
/bin : binary folder, executable file written in ruby
/config: all configuration for our project
/config/database.yml : configuration for database
/db : folder where database information stored (not the database) incl any config file for db
/lib : library folder
/log : store log
/public : store static pages
/tmp : temporary files
/vendor : css or javascript coming from vendor
/.gitignore : a hidden file, when you put to git and you do not want to put something to git
/config.ru :
/Gemfile and /Gemfile.lock
/Rakefile :

5. Run rails server
bin/rails s

6. create database
bin/rake db:create

7. install gem (if needed)
gem 'rails', '4.2.4'
# telling the exactly the gem version, no need to install, if the gem is not installed for your ruby version, Bundler will install it
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0' # its only accept version 5.0.0 to or higher version 5.x.x
gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.1.0' #

# gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0' # its accept any version that greater that 1.3.0.
# 1. Bundler will look in your installed gem for a gem that qualifies the criteria given (version 1.3.0).
# 2. If the gem is not found Bundler will install the latest that qualifis from the source above (in this case https://rubygems.org)
# 3. Bundler will update Gemfile.lock

8. Create controller
bin/rails g controller welcome

route : combination of get request and url
ex. get "/hello"

9. on /config

RAILS DESIGN PATTERNS
MVC: a Wellknown solution for wellknown problem

client --- controller --- model ---- database
                |
               view

controller: control the flow
view: template for display purpose


Convention over configuration
ex. def index # we don't have to define index as its full name index.html.erb
