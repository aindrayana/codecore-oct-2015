# Keep on looping
#
# Given a number n.
# Do the following:
# 1- Generate an array that goes from 1 to the number n
#     (for instance if n=3 array would be [1, 2, 3]
# 2- keep looping through the array eliminating every
#     second number until there is one element left
#     and return that element. If you are at the end of
#     the array loop around the same way.

# For instance. If n = 5 then you get an array [1,2,3,4,5]
# First round you would remove the 2 and 4 ending up
# with: 1, 3, 5 and because there is no element "6"
# you loop around and remove the 1 and then the 5.
# You are then left with number 3.
