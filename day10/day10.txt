REFACTORING
===========
CHanging the arrangement / structure of code without changing the behaviour of the code
minimalize duplication.
1. questions_controller.rb

# "before_action" is action that execute before all actions
# ex. we put line below before we define method in controller (questions_controller.rb)
before_action :find_question, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]


# flash message (like session but it only read once and deleted)
# for instance we want to give a notice after we delete record
# on questions_controller
def destroy
  # @q = Question.find params[:id]
  @q.destroy
  flash[:notice] = "Question deleted successfully"  #we add this line
  redirect_to questions_path
end

# and we add line in layouts/application.html.erb
<%= flash[:notice] || flash[:alert] %>

#so then everytime record deleted, flash will send one time session/cookie
# that used by flash[:notice] tag in application.html.erb
