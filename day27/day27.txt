TDD AND RSPEC MORE ...
======================

  yesterday we build campaign model, we continue with our fundsy app

1.  create controller campaigns
    rails g controller campaigns

2. campaign controller

    describe "#new" do
      context "with user not signed in" do
        it "redirects to user sign up page"
      end
      context "with user signed in" do
        it "renders the new template"
        it "create a new campaign object assigned to 'campaign' instance variable"
      end
    end

3.  add factory_girl to gem file
    gem 'factory_girl_rails'
    bundle

    factory_girl is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax,
    support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances,
    attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for
    the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

    bin/rails g factory_girl:model user
    bin/rails g factory_girl:model campaign

    go to spec/factories

    FactoryGirl.attributes_for(:user)
        2.2-head :003 > FactoryGirl.attributes_for(:user)
        {
            :first_name => "Miguel",
             :last_name => "Ondricka",
                 :email => "johnny@jastruecker.org",
              :password => "12ur0z6zd"
        }

    FactoryGirl.attributes_for(:user).merge({email: nil})
        2.2-head :004 > FactoryGirl.attributes_for(:user).merge({email: nil})
        {
            :first_name => "Junius",
             :last_name => "Ondricka",
                 :email => nil,
              :password => "12ur0z6zd"
        }

    as
